# Vehicle-Efficiency-Prediction-and-Classification
The project showcases advanced data preprocessing techniques, strategic feature engineering, and the creation of new categorical variables such as SUV classification labels. Through PCA implementation, I visualized complex decision boundaries and model performance metrics, providing clear interpretability for automotive efficiency optimization.
